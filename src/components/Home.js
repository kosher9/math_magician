        Mathematical literacy includes learning to read and write different
        types of mathematical texts as part of purposeful mathematical meaning
        making. Thus in this article, we describe how learning to read and write
        mathematical texts (proof text, algorithmic text, algebraic/symbolic
        text, and visual text) supports the development of students&lsquo;
        mathematical literacy. Explicit instruction about how to engage with
        each text type helps to build students&lsquo; awareness of the function of
        mathematical texts and of how to leverage them to support the doing of
        mathematics. Teachers and leaders can use this discussion of
        mathematical text types to organize and conceptualize instruction within
        a disciplinary literacy orientation.
